# Theta Sketch

Theta Sketch are a type of probabilistic data structure designed for approximate set operations, such as estimating the cardinality (number of unique elements) and performing set operations (union, intersection, difference). They are based on the idea of maintaining a subset of the input data, using hashing to determine which elements to include in this subset.
